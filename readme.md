👋 Hi there! I'm Rafał, graduaded at GoIT on the Full Stack Developer course.

🚀 I'm learning and growing every day! My skill set includes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js.

📘 Currently diving into the world of full-stack development to become an even better programmer.

🚗 Outside of coding, you'll find me behind the wheel. I love listening to tech/criminal podcasts while driving.

🥏 In my free time, I relax by playing frisbee, and in the evening, if it's rainy I immerse myself in a good fantasy book, if it's clear view i watch night sky.

🌐 Check out my projects on GitHub, and follow along with my coding journey!
